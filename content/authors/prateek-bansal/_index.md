I am a Presidential Young (Assistant) Professor at the National University of Singapore (NUS).  

My research group, Behavioural Cognitive Science (BeCoS) Lab, is interested in Developing interdisciplinary methods at the intersection of Bayesian Machine Learning, Econometrics, and Computational Psychology to investigate mobility behaviour at an individual level and design mobility systems at an urban scale.
