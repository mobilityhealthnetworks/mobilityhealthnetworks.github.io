Oliver develops bespoke statistical methods for public good. His group is particularly interested in novel Bayesian methods that harness information in viral deep sequence data, mobile phone mobility data, and time-resolved patient data to characterise the spread of infectious diseases, and to guide public health interventions. 

They are involved in a number of multinational data-driven public health projects. He co-leads the [Phylogenetics and Networks of Generalised HIV epidemics in Africa]((https://www.pangea-hiv.org)), and his group develops statistical methods to analyse HIV deep sequence data. He is a member of the Global Reference Group for [children affected by COVID-19](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/the-global-reference-group-on-children-affected-by-covid-19) and help develop methods to quantify the number of children who lost their parents or caregivers to COVID-19. His group works closely with [Emodo Inc.](https://www.emodoinc.com) to harness global mobile phone device data for public good. He is the lead statistician of the LONGVIEW study at the [Rakai Health Sciences Program](https://www.rhsp.org/). His group is affiliated with the [HIV transmission elimination initiative Amsterdam](https://www.pangea-hiv.org) and have joined forces for a future with no new HIV infections.
